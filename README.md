# UI Testing with Selenium

For this lab I had to use Page Object Model design pattern to create a class for a test registration page (http://demoqa.com/registration/). I used the Selenium Web Driver gem to automatically manipulate the web page via code I have written. I then use rspec to run the automation process while also testing aspects of the web page at the same time.

## Getting Started
